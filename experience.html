        I have been a fan of F1 since I was a child. I grew up in Bahrain and would often go watch the F1 with my family.<br><br>
        Watching it live is such a great experience, the cars are unbelievably loud and the sheer speed they are driving is ridiculous.

        <br><br>

         Not only did I watch the F1 live but for a school trip we went to the F1 track and the busses we were on took us for a ride around the track. <br><br>
         If you think that was cool, read this....There is a building next to the track and on the very top floor is the kings chair for when he is watching live.<br><br>
         All of us kids that went on the trip got a turn to sit in the kings chair.
